# Mike Magee - Code Institute Milestone 2 Memory Game


The requirement of this project is to "...build an interactive front-end site. The site should respond to the users' actions, allowing users to actively engage with data, alter the way the site displays the information to achieve their preferred goals."

I selected the memory game to leverage the topics in the previous lessons in a fun way.  I attempted to exceed the concepts that were presented for technologies that introduced programmatic user interaction.

My approach was to provide a simple to use game that has a clean presentation with as little distraction as possible to the user. I avoided any type of arcade game confusion.

## UX 

### User goals 
* A game that is simple to approach and use. 
* Controls and interactions that are familiar and predictable.
* Responsive across device types.
* Somewhat fun. 

### User Stories 
* As a user I expect the game to be fun
* As a user I expect to be able to use the game without instruction
* As a user I expect the interaction to be crisp and predictable
* As a user I expect the game to be challenging enough to capture my attention but easy enough be derive satisfaction 
* As a user I want to be able to observe my success / failure and measure my improvement.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- HTML Validation by freeformatter
    - https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html
- CSS Validation by W3C
    - https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
- Development framework Visual Studio Code (mac) by Microsoft v1.44.1
- Bootstrap  4.1.3 
- Javascript

## Testing 

There should be no visible difference in behavior between browsers.  I have tested with:  
- Chrome Version 81.0.4044.122
- Firefox Version 75.0 (64-bit)
- Safari Version 13.0.5 (15608.5.11)

All tests described below have worked successfully across all browsers.
Responsiveness checks have been run by using the Chrome developers's tools as well as manually resizing the windows

## Deployment

This sample site is set up to use git pages based on the current code version in Github.  Github pages is enabled by going to the settings tab of the github project and enabling github pages.    Github Pages uses the current version of the codeline to serve the application up and is always accessible.  

- Pages location is:  https://michaelmagee.github.io/magee-MS1/


This sample site can easily edited and run locally in the VSCode IDE by using the GoLive feature, which is how this code was developed.  To do this:
- From a terminal in the appropriate location clone a copy of the code locally: 
    - run: `git clone https://github.com/michaelmagee/magee-MS1.git`
    - then run `git remote rm origin` to remove the remote references to github.
- Then from VSCode, open a new window and open the newly cloned directory.   The Go Live button is on the bottom right.
### Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`git pull`   To be sure that the code is current
`python3 -m http.server`  

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.
